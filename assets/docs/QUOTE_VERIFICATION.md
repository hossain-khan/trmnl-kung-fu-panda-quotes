## Issues Found and Resolved

### 1. Duplicate Quotes Removed (6 quotes)

The following duplicate quotes were identified and removed:

| Removed ID | Kept ID | Quote | Author |
|------------|---------|-------|--------|
| 37 | 7 | "Your story may not have such a happy beginning..." | Soothsayer |
| 43 | 6 | "If you only do what you can do..." | Master Shifu |
| 58 | 6 | "If you only do what you can do..." | Master Shifu |
| 57 | 22 | "Your mind is like this water..." | Master Oogway |
| 62 | 3 | "One often meets his destiny..." | Master Oogway |
| 59 | 34 | "There's no charge for awesomeness" | Po |

**Rationale**: Having duplicate quotes reduces variety and wastes valuable quote slots. Each quote ID should be unique, and we kept the first occurrence of each duplicate.

### 2. Grammar Error Fixed (1 quote)

- **Before**: "Maybe Oogway was right about you. You're aren't completely useless after all."
- **After**: "Maybe Oogway was right about you. You aren't completely useless after all."
- **Issue**: Double contraction error ("You're aren't" should be "You aren't")
