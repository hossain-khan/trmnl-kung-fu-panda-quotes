# For future multi-select implementation (requires dynamic backend):
# To enable multi-select, you would need to:
# 1. Use Cloudflare Workers or similar dynamic backend
# 2. Change field_type to "select" with "multiple: true"
# 3. Update the endpoint to parse the comma-separated values
# Example:
# - keyname: "themes"
#   field_type: "select"
#   name: "Quote Themes"
#   optional: false
#   multiple: true
#   options:
#     - "Wisdom"
#     - "Humor"
#   description: "Select one or more themes"
#   help_text: "Use <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>click</kbd> or <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>click</kbd> to select multiple"

# Developer Notes:

# 1. ACCESSING FIELD VALUES IN TEMPLATES
#    {{ trmnl.plugin_settings.custom_fields_values.api_key }}
#    {{ trmnl.plugin_settings.custom_fields_values.data_source }}
#    {{ trmnl.plugin_settings.custom_fields_values.show_details }}
#
# 2. CONDITIONAL DISPLAY
#    {% if trmnl.plugin_settings.custom_fields_values.show_details == "true" %}
#      <!-- Show detailed content -->
#    {% endif %}
#
# 3. FIELD REQUIREMENTS
#    - required: true = User must fill in this field
#    - required: false = Optional field
#    - All required fields must be set before plugin activates
#
# 4. FIELD ORDERING
#    - Fields appear in the order defined in this file
#    - Group related fields together
#    - Put most important fields first
#
# 5. VALIDATION
#    - type: url = Validates URL format
#    - type: email = Validates email format
#    - type: number = Only numeric input allowed
#    - Custom validation in your backend if needed
#
# 6. SECURITY
#    - Never log or expose API keys/secrets
#    - Treat credentials as sensitive
#    - Use HTTPS for webhook URLs
#    - Consider using environment variables for secrets
#
# 7. CONDITIONAL VISIBILITY (Advanced)
#    Some TRMNL versions support conditional field visibility.
#    If supported, you can add "visible_if" to show/hide fields:
#    - visible_if:
#        field: "data_source"
#        value: "source_a"
#      (Shows this field only when data_source == "source_a")
